# Heart Disease Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`heart_disease_analysis.ipynb`) for analyzing a heart disease dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset (`heart_data.csv`) includes various medical indicators that can be used to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset (`heart_data.csv`) contains the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina; 1 = atypical angina; 2 = non-anginal pain; 3 = asymptomatic)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dL
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping; 1 = flat; 2 = downsloping)
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
- **target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no)

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
